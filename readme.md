# Virtual Pet: Animated Penguin

This project is a **virtual pet** application built with Python and PyQt5. The application displays an animated penguin using a series of sprites and allows simple interaction with it.

## Features

- **Sprite Animation:** Multiple frames are shown to create a smooth animation effect.
- **Mouse Interaction:** You can drag the pet around the screen.
- **Context Menu:** Right-clicking opens a menu with options, such as "Greet" (prints a message to the terminal) and "Close" (exits the application).
- **Image Scaling:** Images are scaled to an appropriate size.
